# The Guide to Locate an Item in the Supply Room in the ICU

## BlueBin 2 Bins Kanban System

Our hospital utilizes the BlueBin Kanban system as part of our Supply Chain Management (SCM) process. To access the main dashboard for BlueBin, [click here](https://bluebin.com/). Once on the page, scroll down the left side and click on "BlueQ Find Item Key."

After the page loads, you can sort and filter the items based on your preferences, such as:
* Item ID.
* Item reference. 
* Manufacturing name.
* Item description.
  
**Once you locate your desired item, make note of the sequence ID.**
For example, the sequence ID might be D310.

In the supply room, find rack D, row 3, and place the item in bin 10. For your convenience, items are organized by category in the supply room, with each rack dedicated to a specific category. For instance, rack name A contains all the vital monitoring items, with raw 1 for ECG items, including bin 1 for ECG snaps and bin 2 for ECG wires.
